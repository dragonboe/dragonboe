## üîÆ Innovation at the Core

With over a decade of expertise in system architecture and AI development, I craft solutions that transform theoretical possibilities into practical, high-impact realities. My focus lies in building robust, scalable systems that push technological boundaries while ensuring enterprise-grade security and performance.

```rust
struct Engineer {
    primary_stack: Vec<&'static str>,
    specializations: HashMap<&'static str, Vec<&'static str>>,
    current_focus: &'static str,
}

impl Engineer {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Engineer {
            primary_stack: vec!["C++", "Rust", "Python", "Custom DSL"],
            specializations: HashMap::from([
                ("AI/ML", vec!["TensorFlow", "Custom Neural Architectures", "Advanced ML Systems"]),
                ("Security", vec!["Vulnerability Research", "System Hardening", "Zero-Day Discovery"]),
                ("Systems", vec!["Custom Language Development", "Low-Level Architecture", "Performance Optimization"]),
            ]),
            current_focus: "Advanced AI Systems & Security",
